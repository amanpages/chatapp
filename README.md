This Project is crafted by Md.Aman

1. This is a fullstack chat application where users can chat in real time.
2. Project is built with help of React, Node, Express.
3. To view project in local directory we cna clone the directory and then we can follow instructions below.
3. There is support of image and video sending in chat applicaion.
4. The UI is tried to make a bit glasssmorphic (could have been more attarctive with time) and it is responsive.
5. This has all features like:- realtime chat notifications, realtime chat, image and video sending in chat, group formation, admin group control to remove user, delete group and when e leave he can choose different admin, login and logout functionalities and many more.
6. *** There is an admin panel designed too which can be accessed with the help of secret key that the admin provides. make sure to change the key in server.js file to be same as the key in .env file.
7. Admin panel has all control over user, messages, chat and proper admin view of everything in chart form with animated graphical representation.


Backend:-
1. It has the main entry as server.js file and to begin with the backend of application we first need to install dependencies.
2. And to install dependencies we need to hit the command first by redirecting to the backend folder by (cd backend) and after we are in backend directory we can hit the command (npm install or npm i ) this will install all deppendencies required.
3. Moving on we can start the server by using the command (nodemon server.js) and then the server will restart on local host and database connection is in mongoDb.
4. We have stored enviromental variables which we have provided in sample.env file you cna place your own variable to see the app in your database and server.

Frontend:-
1. In frontend we have to do the same step that is directing to the frontend folder direcory and then using the command line (npm install ) to install all dependencies.
2. After successfull installation of dependencies we can use the command (nom run dev to run in development mode or npm run build to run in build production mode).
3. Then the server will start on port which we can access in our browser.
4. We have used toast notification too to see notifications and there is realtine chat interactions.
